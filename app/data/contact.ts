    "From a young age, I was captivated by how technology could solve real-world problems and bring ideas to life. This curiosity led me to explore programming, where I quickly developed a passion for building user-centric applications. Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with modern technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, and Redux on the frontend, mastering the art of crafting responsive, accessible, and high-performance interfaces.",

    "On the backend, I’ve specialized in building scalable and maintainable APIs using NestJS, Node.js, Express, and Laravel, while managing data through PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL. I’ve also gained solid experience in Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Jest, Cypress, and Cloud platforms like AWS and Vercel. These tools, combined with my passion for clean architecture and agile development practices, have shaped me into a well-rounded full stack developer capable of delivering end-to-end solutions with confidence and precision.",
